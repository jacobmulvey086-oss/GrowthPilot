   ```

2. **Initialize native platforms** (first time only):
   ```bash
   # For iOS (macOS only)
   npx cap add ios
   
   # For Android
   npx cap add android
   ```

3. **Sync web code to native platforms:**
   ```bash
   npx cap sync
   ```

## üì¶ Build Process

### Building for iOS

1. **Open Xcode:**
   ```bash
   npx cap open ios
   ```

2. **In Xcode:**
   - Select your development team in "Signing & Capabilities"
   - Change bundle identifier if needed: `com.growthpilot.app`
   - Select a simulator or connected device
   - Click the Play button to build and run

3. **For App Store submission:**
   - Product ‚Üí Archive
   - Follow Apple's App Store Connect workflow

3. **For Google Play submission:**
   - Build ‚Üí Generate Signed Bundle/APK
   - Follow Google Play Console workflow

## üîÑ Development Workflow

After making changes to your web code:

```bash
# 1. Build the Next.js app
npm run build

# 2. Copy web assets to native projects
npx cap copy

# 3. Open in native IDE to test
npx cap open ios    # or
npx cap open android
```

**Pro tip:** Use `npx cap sync` to both copy and update native dependencies in one command.

1. Create your assets:
   - **App Icon:** 1024x1024px PNG (no transparency)

   ```bash
   npm install -g @capacitor/assets
   npx capacitor-assets generate
   ```

### Push Notifications Setup

**iOS (APNs):**
1. Enable Push Notifications in Xcode capabilities
2. Create APNs certificate in Apple Developer Portal
3. Configure your backend to send notifications

**Android (FCM):**
1. Create Firebase project
2. Add `google-services.json` to `android/app/`
3. Update `android/build.gradle` with FCM dependencies

## üîß Configuration

Edit `capacitor.config.ts` to customize:

```typescript
const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  appId: 'com.growthpilot.app',     // Your unique app ID
  appName: 'GrowthPilot',            // App display name
  webDir: 'out',                      // Next.js export folder
  // ... more options
};
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### iOS Issues

**Pods install fails:**
```bash
cd ios/App
pod install --repo-update
```

**Xcode build errors:**
- Clean build folder: Product ‚Üí Clean Build Folder
- Delete derived data
- Restart Xcode

### Android Issues

**Gradle sync fails:**
- File ‚Üí Invalidate Caches and Restart
- Check Android SDK is up to date
- Verify JDK version (should be 17+)

**Module not found:**
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
```

## üìö Next Steps

### Testing
- Use iOS Simulator and Android Emulator for quick testing
- Test on real devices before submission
- Use TestFlight (iOS) and Internal Testing (Android) for beta distribution

### App Store Submission
- iOS: Submit via App Store Connect
- Android: Submit via Google Play Console
- Both require app privacy policy, screenshots, and descriptions

### Monetization
- Consider switching from Stripe to In-App Purchases (IAP)
- Apple and Google take 15-30% commission
- IAP provides native payment experience
